# Deploy Module Tests

## Test Status

These test files are scaffolded for future implementation:

- `concurrent-deployment.integration.spec.ts` - Integration tests for concurrent deployment scenarios
- `stress-test.spec.ts` - Stress tests for high-volume and performance scenarios

## Current State

The tests are currently **NOT RUNNABLE** because:

1. They require full deployment method implementations that don't exist yet
2. They need proper mocking of Supabase and other dependencies
3. They are integration tests that require environment setup

## Purpose

These test files serve as:
- Documentation of expected behavior
- Guide for future implementation
- Type-safe scaffolding that compiles correctly

## Running Tests

Once the deploy module is fully implemented, these tests will need:

1. Environment variables:
```bash
export SUPABASE_URL=your_url
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```

2. Proper mocking setup in test files
3. Implementation of the tested methods in DeploymentService

## Note

These tests pass TypeScript compilation and linting but will fail at runtime until the deploy module implementation is complete.
