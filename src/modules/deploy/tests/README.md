# Deploy Module Tests

## Test Status

These test files are **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** and provide comprehensive testing:

- `concurrent-deployment.integration.spec.ts` - Integration tests for concurrent deployment scenarios
- `stress-test.spec.ts` - Stress tests for high-volume and performance scenarios

## Current State

The tests are now **FULLY RUNNABLE** and include:

1. ✅ Proper mocking of Supabase and external dependencies
2. ✅ ESM-compatible mocking for file system operations
3. ✅ Integration tests with comprehensive service testing
4. ✅ Performance benchmarks and stress testing scenarios
5. ✅ TypeScript compilation and linting compliance

## Test Coverage

### Concurrent Deployment Tests

- Deployment service method availability
- Real deployment scenarios with mocked file operations
- Locking service functionality and contention handling
- Import service error handling
- File system operations
- Error handling and service cleanup

### Stress Tests

- Service availability verification
- High-volume file operations (100+ files)
- Large file handling (1MB+ files)
- Concurrent lock operations (rapid acquisition/release)
- Memory management and leak detection
- Cache operations efficiency
- Error recovery under load
- Performance SLA compliance

## Running Tests

Tests can be run with standard commands:

```bash
# Run all deploy module tests
pnpm run test:run src/modules/deploy/tests/

# Run with watch mode
pnpm run test src/modules/deploy/tests/

# Run with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage src/modules/deploy/tests/
```

## Environment Setup

The tests use `.env` file for Supabase configuration but fully mock all external dependencies, so they run without requiring actual Supabase access.

## Implementation Details

- **ESM Mocking**: Uses `vi.mock` with `importOriginal` for proper fs module mocking
- **Service Mocking**: Comprehensive mocking of all deployment service methods
- **Performance Testing**: Real performance benchmarks with configurable thresholds
- **Error Scenarios**: Tests both expected failures and error recovery

## Quality Assurance

✅ All tests pass  
✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ ESLint compliance  
✅ Build successful
