# Auth Module Refactoring Requirements Document

## Introduction

The auth module requires refactoring to address current limitations in type safety, code organization, and maintainability. The refactoring will establish a solid foundation for OAuth authentication with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive type definitions, and strict quality assurance practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Type Safety and Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type definitions for all auth-related operations, so that I can write type-safe code and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import auth types THEN all interfaces and types are strongly typed
2. WHEN I use auth services THEN TypeScript provides accurate autocomplete and type checking
3. WHEN I pass parameters to auth functions THEN invalid types are caught at compile time
4. IF I modify auth interfaces THEN all dependent code shows type errors appropriately
5. WHEN I build the project THEN there are no TypeScript compilation errors in auth module

### Requirement 2: Service Layer Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between different auth concerns, so that I can maintain and test each component independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at AuthService THEN it only contains core authentication business logic
2. WHEN I examine SessionService THEN it only handles session persistence operations
3. WHEN I review OAuthProviderService THEN it only manages OAuth provider interactions
4. IF I need to change session storage THEN I only modify the SessionService
5. WHEN I add a new OAuth provider THEN I only modify the OAuthProviderService

### Requirement 3: Command Layer Refactoring

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want auth commands that are focused on user interaction and input validation, so that business logic is properly separated and commands are easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine auth commands THEN they contain minimal business logic
2. WHEN commands handle errors THEN they provide clear, user-friendly messages
3. WHEN I use auth commands THEN input validation happens at the command level
4. IF a service throws an error THEN the command handles it appropriately
5. WHEN commands complete THEN they provide meaningful success feedback

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the auth module, so that I can refactor confidently and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run unit tests THEN all auth services have >80% code coverage
2. WHEN I run integration tests THEN service interactions work correctly
3. WHEN I run end-to-end tests THEN the full OAuth flow works properly
4. IF I modify auth code THEN relevant tests fail appropriately
5. WHEN tests run THEN they complete within reasonable time limits (<30s)

### Requirement 5: Code Quality Compliance

**User Story:** As a team member, I want all auth module code to pass linting and formatting checks, so that code style is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `pnpm run lint` THEN auth module code passes all ESLint rules
2. WHEN I run `pnpm run format` THEN auth module code is properly formatted
3. WHEN I run TypeScript compiler THEN auth module compiles without errors
4. IF I commit auth changes THEN pre-commit hooks pass successfully
5. WHEN I build the project THEN auth module builds without warnings

### Requirement 6: Type-Safe OAuth Provider Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe OAuth provider management, so that provider configurations are validated and OAuth flows are predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure OAuth providers THEN configuration is type-checked
2. WHEN OAuth flow starts THEN provider capabilities are validated
3. WHEN callback is received THEN response structure is type-validated
4. IF provider configuration is invalid THEN clear error messages are provided
5. WHEN I add new providers THEN existing providers continue to work

### Requirement 7: Secure Session Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want secure session management with proper encryption and expiration handling, so that my authentication state is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are stored THEN sensitive data is properly secured
2. WHEN sessions expire THEN they are automatically cleaned up
3. WHEN I logout THEN all session data is completely removed
4. IF session storage fails THEN user is notified appropriately
5. WHEN sessions are loaded THEN validity is verified before use

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want clear error messages and recovery guidance when authentication fails, so that I can resolve issues independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth flow fails THEN I receive specific error messages
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN retry options are suggested
3. WHEN sessions are invalid THEN re-authentication is triggered
4. IF configuration is wrong THEN setup guidance is provided
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they are logged for debugging purposes

### Requirement 9: Dependency Injection and Testability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection in auth services, so that components are loosely coupled and easily testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine service constructors THEN dependencies are injected properly
2. WHEN I write tests THEN I can easily mock service dependencies
3. WHEN services interact THEN coupling is through well-defined interfaces
4. IF I need to replace a dependency THEN I only modify injection configuration
5. WHEN I run tests THEN mocked dependencies work correctly

### Requirement 10: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want auth operations to be fast and resource-efficient, so that authentication doesn't slow down my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start OAuth flow THEN callback server starts quickly (<2s)
2. WHEN authentication completes THEN callback server is cleaned up properly
3. WHEN sessions are accessed THEN file I/O is minimized through caching
4. IF multiple auth operations run THEN they don't conflict with each other
5. WHEN CLI exits THEN all auth resources are properly cleaned up
