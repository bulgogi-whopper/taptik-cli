# Auth Module Refactoring Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create TypeScript Type Definitions
  - Create `src/modules/auth/types/index.ts` with all auth-related types
  - Define `AuthProvider`, `AuthenticationResult`, `AuthError` interfaces
  - Define `SessionStorageOptions`, `OAuthCallbackData`, `SessionMetadata` types
  - Create provider-specific types for Google and GitHub OAuth
  - Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all types
  - _Requirements: Type Safety and Definitions, Dependency Injection and Testability_

- [ ] 2. Refactor Session Management Service
  - Extract session logic from AuthService into dedicated `SessionService`
  - Implement `ISessionStorage` interface for storage abstraction
  - Add session validation, expiration, and cleanup methods
  - Implement secure session encryption for sensitive data
  - Add comprehensive error handling for storage operations
  - _Requirements: Service Layer Separation, Secure Session Management_

- [ ] 3. Create OAuth Provider Service
  - Extract OAuth logic into dedicated `OAuthProviderService`
  - Implement provider factory pattern for Google/GitHub providers
  - Abstract callback server management into provider service
  - Add provider-specific configuration validation
  - Implement proper cleanup of OAuth resources
  - _Requirements: Service Layer Separation, Type-Safe OAuth Provider Management_

- [ ] 4. Refactor Core Authentication Service
  - Simplify `AuthService` to focus only on core auth business logic
  - Inject `SessionService` and `OAuthProviderService` dependencies
  - Remove direct file I/O and HTTP server management
  - Add proper error handling with typed error responses
  - Implement authentication state management
  - _Requirements: Service Layer Separation, Error Handling and Recovery_

- [ ] 5. Update Command Layer
  - Refactor auth commands to use dependency injection
  - Remove business logic from command handlers
  - Add comprehensive input validation with typed parameters
  - Improve error messages and user feedback
  - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
  - _Requirements: Command Layer Refactoring, Error Handling and Recovery_

- [ ] 6. Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests
  - Add unit tests for all new services with >80% coverage
  - Mock all external dependencies (Supabase, file system, HTTP)
  - Test error conditions and edge cases thoroughly
  - Add performance benchmarks for critical operations
  - Ensure all tests pass TypeScript compilation
  - _Requirements: Comprehensive Testing, Code Quality Compliance_

- [ ] 7. Add Integration Tests
  - Create integration tests for service interactions
  - Test OAuth flow with mock providers
  - Verify session persistence across service boundaries
  - Test error propagation between service layers
  - Add tests for dependency injection container
  - _Requirements: Comprehensive Testing, Dependency Injection and Testability_

- [ ] 8. Ensure Code Quality Compliance
  - Run and fix all ESLint violations in auth module
  - Apply Prettier formatting to all auth module files
  - Fix all TypeScript compilation errors and warnings
  - Add pre-commit hooks for auth module quality checks
  - Optimize imports and remove unused dependencies
  - _Requirements: Code Quality Compliance, Performance and Resource Management_

- [ ] 9. Add End-to-End Authentication Tests
  - Create E2E tests for complete OAuth flows
  - Test session management across CLI sessions
  - Add tests for error scenarios and recovery
  - Verify cleanup of temporary resources
  - Test authentication with both Google and GitHub providers
  - _Requirements: Comprehensive Testing, Performance and Resource Management_

- [ ] 10. Documentation and API Polish
  - Update inline documentation for all refactored components
  - Create comprehensive README for auth module architecture
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common authentication issues
  - Document OAuth provider setup and configuration
  - Add examples for extending auth module functionality
  - _Requirements: Error Handling and Recovery, Type-Safe OAuth Provider Management_
