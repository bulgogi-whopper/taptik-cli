# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `taptik build` command is a core feature of the taptik CLI tool that enables users to collect and standardize AI IDE settings for migration between different platforms. This command provides an interactive interface for users to select their source platform (currently Kiro) and choose which categories of settings to collect, then converts them into taptik's standardized specification format for later synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using AI IDEs, I want to interactively select my source platform and setting categories, so that I can build a standardized configuration bundle for migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `npx taptik build` THEN the system SHALL display an interactive platform selection menu with Kiro, Cursor, and Claude Code options
2. WHEN the user selects a platform other than Kiro THEN the system SHALL display a "coming soon" message and exit gracefully
3. WHEN the user selects Kiro THEN the system SHALL proceed to category selection
4. WHEN the user is presented with category selection THEN the system SHALL offer Personal Context, Project Context, and Prompt Templates as multi-selectable options
5. WHEN the user makes no category selection THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message and exit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to collect both local project settings and global Kiro settings, so that I can migrate my complete development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting local settings THEN the system SHALL scan the current project's `.kiro/` directory for configuration files
2. WHEN collecting global settings THEN the system SHALL access the user's home directory Kiro configuration files
3. WHEN accessing global settings fails due to permissions THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and continue with available settings
4. WHEN no Kiro settings are found THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message explaining how to set up Kiro
5. WHEN settings files are corrupted or invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip the problematic file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my collected settings to be converted into taptik's standardized format, so that they can be used for cross-platform migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Personal Context is selected THEN the system SHALL convert Kiro user preferences and profile data to the personal context specification
2. WHEN Project Context is selected THEN the system SHALL convert Kiro project settings to the project context specification
3. WHEN Prompt Templates is selected THEN the system SHALL convert Kiro prompt templates to the prompt templates specification
4. WHEN conversion encounters invalid data THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use default values where possible
5. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL validate the output against the taptik specification schema

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build output to be organized in a timestamped directory with clear metadata, so that I can easily identify and manage my configuration builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL create a directory named `taptik-build-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
2. WHEN creating output files THEN the system SHALL generate separate JSON files for each selected category
3. WHEN creating the build THEN the system SHALL generate a manifest.json file with build metadata including source files, timestamps, and categories
4. WHEN the build is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing the output directory and file sizes
5. WHEN the output directory already exists THEN the system SHALL create a new directory with an incremented suffix

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual feedback during the build process, so that I understand what the system is doing and can identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process starts THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators with descriptive messages
2. WHEN scanning for settings THEN the system SHALL show spinner animations with status text
3. WHEN conversion is in progress THEN the system SHALL display which category is being processed
4. WHEN the build completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message with output location and file details
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle security-sensitive information appropriately, so that my credentials and private data remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting settings THEN the system SHALL exclude API keys, tokens, and authentication credentials
2. WHEN processing configuration files THEN the system SHALL filter out sensitive fields like passwords and private keys
3. WHEN encountering encrypted data THEN the system SHALL skip it and log a warning
4. WHEN building the output THEN the system SHALL not include any personally identifiable information beyond what's necessary for configuration
5. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL respect file permissions and fail gracefully if access is denied

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using different operating systems, I want the build command to work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that I can use taptik regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Windows path separators and home directory detection
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL use Unix-style paths and macOS-specific Kiro installation locations
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL use Unix-style paths and Linux-specific configuration directories
4. WHEN detecting the home directory THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate environment variables for each platform
5. WHEN file operations fail due to platform differences THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific error messages and solutions
