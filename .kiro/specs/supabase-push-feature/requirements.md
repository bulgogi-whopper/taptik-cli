# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload (push) their local Taptik configuration packages to Supabase cloud storage, making them available for sharing, backup, and synchronization across different development environments. Building on the existing Supabase integration and the claude-code-build-feature, this functionality provides seamless configuration upload with metadata generation, security sanitization, and cloud discovery optimization.

The push feature extends the existing `taptik build` workflow by adding cloud upload capabilities, allowing users to share their configurations with teams or the broader community through the Taptik platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload my built Taptik packages to Supabase cloud storage, so that I can share my configurations with my team and back them up securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `taptik push <package-file>` THEN the system SHALL upload the specified .taptik package to Supabase Storage
2. WHEN uploading a package THEN the system SHALL validate the package format and ensure it's a valid .taptik file
3. WHEN upload occurs THEN the system SHALL generate a unique config ID and store package metadata in the database
4. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL return a shareable URL and config ID for the uploaded package
5. IF the package file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with suggested alternatives
6. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prompt for login before allowing upload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify visibility and metadata when pushing configurations, so that I can control who can access my configurations and make them discoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `--public` flag THEN the configuration SHALL be publicly discoverable and downloadable by anyone
2. WHEN I use `--private` flag (default) THEN the configuration SHALL only be accessible by the authenticated user
3. WHEN I specify `--title "My Config"` THEN the system SHALL use the provided title for the configuration metadata
4. WHEN I specify `--description "Description"` THEN the system SHALL store the description for search and discovery
5. WHEN I specify `--tags tag1,tag2,tag3` THEN the system SHALL associate the tags with the configuration for filtering
6. WHEN no title is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a default title based on the package filename and timestamp
7. WHEN uploading THEN the system SHALL automatically extract and add platform-specific tags (e.g., "claude-code", "kiro-ide")

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic security sanitization during upload, so that sensitive information is never accidentally shared in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a package THEN the system SHALL scan for sensitive patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords, email addresses)
2. WHEN sensitive data is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically sanitize or remove it before upload
3. WHEN sanitization occurs THEN the system SHALL generate a sanitization report showing what was removed
4. WHEN critical sensitive data is found THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation with `--force` flag to proceed
5. WHEN uploading with `--force` THEN the system SHALL log a security warning and proceed with sanitized content
6. IF sanitization fails THEN the system SHALL block the upload and provide specific remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the push command to integrate seamlessly with the build workflow, so that I can build and upload configurations in a single operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `taptik build --platform=claude-code --push` THEN the system SHALL build the configuration and automatically upload it
2. WHEN using `--push` with build THEN the system SHALL support all push-specific flags (--public, --title, --tags, --description)
3. WHEN build and push complete THEN the system SHALL display both build summary and upload confirmation with shareable URL
4. WHEN build fails THEN the system SHALL not attempt to push and SHALL display build errors
5. WHEN build succeeds but push fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the built package locally and display push error details
6. IF authentication is required during build-push THEN the system SHALL prompt for login before starting the build process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive metadata generation and cloud optimization, so that my uploaded configurations are easily discoverable and searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a package THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including platform, components, complexity, and file count
2. WHEN generating metadata THEN the system SHALL create searchable keywords from configuration content and filenames
3. WHEN processing the package THEN the system SHALL generate auto-tags based on detected technologies, frameworks, and patterns
4. WHEN storing metadata THEN the system SHALL include package size, upload timestamp, and version information
5. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL optimize the package for cloud delivery with compression and checksums
6. IF metadata extraction fails THEN the system SHALL use basic metadata and log warnings about missing information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and progress tracking during upload, so that I can monitor large uploads and recover from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading large packages (>10MB) THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators with percentage and ETA
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN upload is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resumable uploads for packages larger than 5MB
4. WHEN authentication expires during upload THEN the system SHALL refresh tokens automatically and continue
5. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes and suggested remediation actions
6. IF storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display quota information and upgrade options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage my uploaded configurations, so that I can update, delete, or modify the visibility of my shared configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `taptik list --cloud` THEN the system SHALL display all my uploaded configurations with metadata
2. WHEN I run `taptik update <config-id> --title "New Title"` THEN the system SHALL update the configuration metadata

4. WHEN I run `taptik visibility <config-id> --public` THEN the system SHALL change the configuration visibility
5. WHEN I run `taptik stats <config-id>` THEN the system SHALL display download count, likes, and usage statistics
6. IF I try to modify a configuration I don't own THEN the system SHALL display an authorization error

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the push feature to follow existing architecture patterns with a dedicated PushModule, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows single responsibility principles.
