# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up comprehensive Supabase client integration for the NestJS CLI
project with authentication, storage, and database capabilities. The goal is to establish secure
cloud-based configuration synchronization, user authentication, and seamless data management for
AI development environment configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Supabase client integration with
authentication and storage capabilities, so that I can securely sync configurations across
different AI development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Supabase client is initialized THEN it SHALL connect using environment variables and
   validate configuration
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the client SHALL support OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
   with session persistence
3. WHEN configurations are managed THEN the client SHALL integrate seamlessly with NestJS CLI
   commands
4. WHEN the client runs THEN it SHALL work with the existing `@nestjs/config` module and
   environment setup
5. IF there are connection errors THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure storage operations for configuration files, so that
I can upload, download, and manage my AI development configurations in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are uploaded THEN Supabase Storage SHALL store files securely with proper
   metadata
2. WHEN configurations are retrieved THEN the client SHALL download files efficiently with error
   handling
3. WHEN storage operations run THEN they SHALL include listing, versioning, and deletion
   capabilities
4. WHEN file operations occur THEN they SHALL respect user permissions and access controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support and testing coverage, so that
the Supabase integration is maintainable and reliable for team use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN there SHALL be comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL achieve minimum 80% code coverage with proper mocking
3. WHEN the client is used THEN it SHALL provide full IntelliSense support for all operations
4. WHEN new team members join THEN they SHALL have clear documentation and usage examples
5. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN they SHALL be easy to modify and extend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Supabase integration to work efficiently with the
existing NestJS CLI architecture, so that it integrates smoothly with current development
workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN client initialization occurs THEN it SHALL complete in under 500ms with lazy loading
2. WHEN the integration runs THEN it SHALL work with existing NestJS decorators and patterns
3. WHEN CLI commands execute THEN they SHALL have direct access to the Supabase client instance
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be compatible with current Node.js and TypeScript
   versions
5. WHEN the setup is complete THEN existing commands SHALL integrate Supabase functionality with
   minimal changes
