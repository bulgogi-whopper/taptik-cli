# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up comprehensive ESLint and Prettier configuration for the NestJS CLI project with enhanced code quality plugins including eslint-plugin-unicorn and eslint-plugin-import-x. The goal is to establish consistent code formatting, catch potential issues early, and enforce modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive ESLint configuration with unicorn and import-x plugins, so that I can catch potential issues and enforce modern coding standards automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is linted THEN eslint-plugin-unicorn SHALL enforce modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns and prevent common mistakes
2. WHEN imports are used THEN eslint-plugin-import-x SHALL validate import/export syntax and organization
3. WHEN code is written THEN ESLint SHALL integrate with existing TypeScript parser and NestJS patterns
4. WHEN linting runs THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with the existing `npm run lint` script
5. IF there are linting errors THEN they SHALL be automatically fixable where possible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Prettier configuration that works harmoniously with ESLint, so that code formatting is consistent and doesn't conflict with linting rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is formatted THEN Prettier SHALL format TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, and Markdown files consistently
2. WHEN ESLint and Prettier run together THEN there SHALL be no conflicting rules between them
3. WHEN the format script runs THEN it SHALL format all relevant files in src and test directories
4. WHEN code is saved THEN formatting SHALL be consistent with team standards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration files for both tools, so that the setup is maintainable and can be easily understood by team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN there SHALL be a comprehensive .eslintrc.js configuration file
2. WHEN the project is set up THEN there SHALL be a .prettierrc configuration file
3. WHEN the project is set up THEN there SHALL be appropriate ignore files (.eslintignore, .prettierignore)
4. WHEN new team members join THEN they SHALL be able to understand the configuration easily
5. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN they SHALL be easy to modify and extend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting and formatting tools to integrate with the existing NestJS project structure, so that they work well with the current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting runs THEN it SHALL respect NestJS decorators and patterns
2. WHEN linting runs THEN it SHALL work with the existing TypeScript configuration
3. WHEN the tools run THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing package.json scripts
4. WHEN dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be compatible with the current Node.js and TypeScript versions
5. WHEN the setup is complete THEN existing code SHALL pass linting with minimal required changes
