# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the test framework from Jest to Vitest for the Taptik CLI project.
Vitest provides faster test execution, better TypeScript integration, and modern development
experience while maintaining Jest API compatibility. The goal is to improve test performance,
developer experience, and alignment with modern tooling ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Jest to Vitest, so that I can benefit from
faster test execution and better TypeScript integration without losing existing test functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN Vitest SHALL run all existing tests without functional changes
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN Vitest SHALL provide faster execution compared to Jest
3. WHEN tests are written THEN Vitest SHALL support the same API as Jest for minimal code changes
4. WHEN coverage is generated THEN Vitest SHALL provide accurate coverage reports matching Jest
   standards
5. WHEN tests run in watch mode THEN Vitest SHALL provide hot reload capabilities for improved
   developer experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Vitest configuration, so that the testing
environment is optimized for the NestJS CLI project structure and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vitest is configured THEN it SHALL work with TypeScript without additional compilation steps
2. WHEN tests are organized THEN Vitest SHALL support the existing test file patterns (_.spec.ts,
   _.test.ts)
3. WHEN path aliases are used THEN Vitest SHALL resolve imports correctly with @ and @test aliases
4. WHEN E2E tests run THEN they SHALL have separate configuration with appropriate timeouts
5. WHEN global test APIs are used THEN describe, it, expect SHALL be available without imports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper migration of existing test files, so that all
Jest-specific syntax is correctly converted to Vitest equivalents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are migrated THEN Jest imports SHALL be replaced with Vitest equivalents
2. WHEN mocking is used THEN jest.fn() SHALL be replaced with vi.fn()
3. WHEN spying is used THEN jest.spyOn() SHALL be replaced with vi.spyOn()
4. WHEN mocked functions are typed THEN jest.mocked() SHALL be replaced with vi.mocked()
5. WHEN global setup is needed THEN test/setup.ts SHALL provide equivalent functionality to Jest
   setup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want NestJS testing integration to work seamlessly with Vitest, so
that existing test patterns for commands and services continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NestJS testing modules are used THEN @nestjs/testing SHALL work without modification
2. WHEN dependency injection is tested THEN TestingModule.createTestingModule SHALL function
   correctly
3. WHEN CLI commands are tested THEN nest-commander testing patterns SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN HTTP testing is needed THEN supertest integration SHALL work with Vitest
5. WHEN test utilities are used THEN custom testing helpers SHALL be compatible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated package.json scripts and CI/CD integration, so that
the development workflow and automation continue to work with Vitest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package scripts run THEN test, test:watch, test:coverage SHALL execute with Vitest
2. WHEN UI testing is needed THEN test:ui script SHALL provide Vitest UI interface
3. WHEN E2E tests run THEN test:e2e SHALL use separate Vitest configuration
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN GitHub Actions SHALL execute tests and generate coverage reports
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN Jest packages SHALL be removed and Vitest packages SHALL be
   added

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive coverage reporting with Vitest, so that code
quality metrics are maintained or improved from the Jest setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage is generated THEN v8 provider SHALL provide accurate coverage metrics
2. WHEN coverage thresholds are checked THEN they SHALL match or exceed current Jest thresholds
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN text, JSON, and HTML formats SHALL be available
4. WHEN coverage excludes are applied THEN node_modules, dist, and test directories SHALL be
   excluded
5. WHEN coverage is analyzed THEN it SHALL provide line, branch, function, and statement coverage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation and migration guides, so that team
members can understand the changes and work effectively with the new testing setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL explain the Vitest setup
2. WHEN new tests are written THEN examples SHALL show proper Vitest patterns for commands and
   services
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN documentation SHALL explain debugging with Vitest
4. WHEN performance is analyzed THEN benchmarks SHALL demonstrate improvement over Jest
5. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN common migration issues and solutions SHALL be documented
