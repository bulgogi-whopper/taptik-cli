# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for adding Kiro IDE support to the existing `taptik deploy` command. Currently, the deploy command only supports Claude Code as a target platform. This enhancement will extend the deployment functionality to support Kiro IDE, enabling users to deploy their Taptik configurations to Kiro IDE environments.

The `deploy` command imports Taptik common format configurations from Supabase (created by the `build` command) and converts them to target IDE-specific formats. For Kiro IDE, this involves transforming TaptikPersonalContext, TaptikProjectContext, and TaptikPromptTemplates into Kiro's directory structure and file formats.

The feature builds upon the existing deploy architecture and adds Kiro-specific deployment logic, validation, and component mapping while maintaining backward compatibility with Claude Code deployments.

## Architecture Context

### Data Flow
1. `build` command: Local IDE settings → Taptik common format → Supabase
2. `deploy` command: Supabase → Taptik common format → Target IDE settings

### Taptik Common Format Structure
- **TaptikPersonalContext**: User preferences, global settings
- **TaptikProjectContext**: Project-specific settings, steering documents, specs
- **TaptikPromptTemplates**: AI prompts and templates
