# Context Migration Feature Requirements Document (MVP)

## Introduction

The context migration feature enables seamless bidirectional transfer of development environments, configurations, and preferences between Kiro and Claude Code AI IDEs. This MVP focuses on perfect interoperability between these two platforms, allowing developers to build, store, and deploy their complete development context with full feature preservation and intelligent mapping where differences exist.

## MVP Scope: Kiro ↔ Claude Code Migration

This initial release focuses exclusively on Kiro and Claude Code platforms to ensure:
