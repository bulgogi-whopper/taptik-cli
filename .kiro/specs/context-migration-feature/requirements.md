# Context Migration Feature Requirements Document

## Introduction

The context migration feature enables seamless bidirectional transfer of development environments, configurations, and preferences between Kiro and Claude Code AI IDEs. This MVP focuses on perfect interoperability between these two platforms, allowing developers to build, store, and deploy their complete development context with full feature preservation and intelligent mapping where differences exist.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Context Building and Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build a comprehensive context bundle from my current IDE environment, so that I can capture all my settings, preferences, and configurations in a portable format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN the build completes THEN a standardized context bundle is created locally
5. IF sensitive data is detected THEN it is excluded or encrypted appropriately
6. WHEN I specify `--include` or `--exclude` flags THEN only selected categories are processed
7. WHEN the build fails THEN clear error messages indicate what went wrong

### Requirement 2: Context Storage and Cloud Sync
