# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The InfoModule feature provides users with comprehensive system information and status display capabilities for the Taptik CLI application. This module enables users to quickly view their current authentication status, configuration details, synchronization history, and system information through intuitive CLI commands. The feature serves as a central information hub that helps users understand their current state within the application ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to view my current authentication status and account information, so that I can verify I'm logged in with the correct account and understand my current session state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the info command THEN the system SHALL display my current authentication status (logged in/out)
2. WHEN I am authenticated THEN the system SHALL show my account email and provider (Google/GitHub)
3. WHEN I am not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating I need to log in
4. WHEN displaying account info THEN the system SHALL show the last login timestamp
5. IF my session is expired THEN the system SHALL indicate the session status and suggest re-authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple AI tools, I want to see information about my current development environment and tool configuration, so that I can understand which tool settings are currently active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request system info THEN the system SHALL display the current tool name and version
2. WHEN showing tool info THEN the system SHALL indicate the detected IDE or development environment
3. WHEN configuration is available THEN the system SHALL show the last configuration update timestamp
4. WHEN multiple tools are detected THEN the system SHALL list all detected development environments
5. IF no supported tools are detected THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message about supported tools

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing configuration synchronization, I want to view my synchronization history and status, so that I can track when configurations were last synced and identify any sync issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check sync status THEN the system SHALL display the last synchronization timestamp
2. WHEN showing sync info THEN the system SHALL indicate the number of saved configurations in my account
3. WHEN sync history exists THEN the system SHALL show the most recent push/pull operations
4. WHEN there are sync errors THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggested actions
5. IF no sync history exists THEN the system SHALL show a message encouraging first-time setup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to access detailed system information and diagnostics, so that I can troubleshoot issues and verify my installation is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request detailed info THEN the system SHALL display CLI version and build information
2. WHEN showing system details THEN the system SHALL include Node.js version and platform information
3. WHEN displaying diagnostics THEN the system SHALL show Supabase connection status
4. WHEN checking installation THEN the system SHALL verify all required dependencies are available
5. IF there are system issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information and resolution steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the info command to be fast and reliable, so that I can quickly check my status without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the info command THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show cached information and indicate offline status
3. WHEN Supabase is unreachable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and show local information
4. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use clear formatting and colors for better readability
5. IF information retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL show partial information and indicate what failed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the info service to be thoroughly tested and reliable, so that I can trust the information displayed is accurate and the feature won't break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the InfoService is tested THEN all methods SHALL have comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking
2. WHEN testing authentication status THEN the tests SHALL cover both authenticated and unauthenticated states
3. WHEN testing tool detection THEN the tests SHALL mock various development environment scenarios
4. WHEN testing sync information THEN the tests SHALL handle both successful and failed API responses
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the tests SHALL verify proper error handling and user-friendly messages
