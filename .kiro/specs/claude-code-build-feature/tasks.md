# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to build the Claude Code feature incrementally and safely. Each task follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle: write failing tests first, implement minimal code to pass tests, then refactor for quality. This approach ensures robust, well-tested code with immediate feedback and prevents regression bugs.

## TDD Implementation Strategy

**Core Principle**: Test → Interface → Implementation → Refactor

Each major feature follows this pattern:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Add more tests for edge cases and additional functionality
