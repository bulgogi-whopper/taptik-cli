# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ListCommand feature provides users with the ability to query and display available configuration packages from the Taptik cloud storage. This module enables users to discover, search, and explore configurations uploaded by themselves and other users through a simple CLI interface. The feature serves as the primary discovery mechanism for the Taptik ecosystem, focusing on essential listing functionality with basic filtering and sorting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to view a list of available configuration packages from the cloud, so that I can discover and explore configurations that I might want to download and use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `taptik list` THEN the system SHALL display a table of available public configuration packages
2. WHEN displaying the list THEN the system SHALL show ID, Title, Created date, Size, and Access level for each configuration
3. WHEN no configurations are available THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message indicating the empty state
4. WHEN the list is long THEN the system SHALL limit results to 20 items by default
5. IF I am not authenticated THEN the system SHALL only show public configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to filter configuration packages by title, so that I can quickly find configurations relevant to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `--filter <query>` THEN the system SHALL search in configuration titles
2. WHEN the filter matches configurations THEN the system SHALL display only matching results
3. WHEN the filter matches no configurations THEN the system SHALL display "No configurations found matching your filter"
4. WHEN I provide an empty filter THEN the system SHALL treat it as no filter applied
5. IF the filter query contains special characters THEN the system SHALL handle them safely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to sort configuration packages by different criteria, so that I can view them in my preferred order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `--sort date` THEN the system SHALL sort configurations by creation date (newest first)
2. WHEN I use `--sort name` THEN the system SHALL sort configurations alphabetically by title
3. WHEN I don't specify sort THEN the system SHALL default to date sorting
4. IF I provide an invalid sort option THEN the system SHALL show an error with valid options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to control the number of results displayed, so that I can manage the output according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `--limit <n>` THEN the system SHALL display at most n configurations
2. WHEN I don't specify a limit THEN the system SHALL default to 20 results
3. WHEN I specify a limit of 0 THEN the system SHALL show an error
4. WHEN I specify a limit greater than 100 THEN the system SHALL cap it at 100
5. IF the available configurations are fewer than the limit THEN the system SHALL show all available configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view configurations that I have liked, so that I can easily access my favorite configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `taptik list liked` THEN the system SHALL display configurations I have liked
2. WHEN I am not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prompt me to log in first
3. WHEN I have no liked configurations THEN the system SHALL display "You haven't liked any configurations yet"
4. WHEN displaying liked configurations THEN the system SHALL use the same table format as regular list
5. IF there's an error fetching liked configurations THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the list command to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there's a network error THEN the system SHALL display "Unable to connect to Taptik cloud. Please check your internet connection."
2. WHEN there's an authentication error THEN the system SHALL display "Authentication failed. Please run 'taptik login' first."
3. WHEN there's a server error THEN the system SHALL display "Taptik cloud is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."
4. WHEN an invalid option is provided THEN the system SHALL show command help with valid options
5. IF any error occurs THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate error code (non-zero)
