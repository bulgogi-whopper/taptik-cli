## Testing Strategy

Each task includes comprehensive unit tests written before implementation (TDD approach). Integration tests are implemented in tasks 9.1-9.3 to validate component interactions. System testing in task 13.1 validates the complete feature functionality.

- Tasks 3-5 can be developed in parallel after task 2 completion
- Task 6 depends on completion of tasks 3-5
- Task 7 depends on completion of task 6
- Tasks 8-12 can be developed in parallel after task 7
- Task 13 requires completion of all previous tasks

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass with >80% code coverage
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality
- Security validation prevents malicious content deployment
- Performance meets requirements (deployment <15 seconds)
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing platforms
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Complete documentation and help system
