# Requirements Document - Claude Code Deploy Feature

## Introduction

This feature enables users to **import** configurations from Supabase cloud storage and **deploy** them specifically to **Claude Code IDE**. Building on the existing Supabase integration, this functionality provides seamless configuration synchronization from cloud to local development environment with comprehensive validation, security scanning, and automated deployment processes.

## Scope

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Claude Code deployment only
- **Phase 2 (Future)**: Multi-IDE support (Kiro, Cursor)
- **Responsibility**: Deploy functionality only (Export/Upload handled separately)

## Test-Driven Development Approach

All implementation SHALL follow strict TDD methodology with tests written before code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 0 - Test-Driven Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage written BEFORE implementation, so that the deploy functionality is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new feature THEN unit tests SHALL be written first following Red-Green-Refactor cycle
2. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL achieve minimum 80% coverage with meaningful assertions
3. WHEN tests pass THEN implementation code SHALL be written to satisfy them with minimal complexity
4. WHEN refactoring THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass without modification
5. IF tests fail THEN implementation SHALL be fixed before proceeding to next feature

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to import configurations from Supabase cloud storage, so that I can retrieve Claude Code configurations for local deployment.

**Definition of Success:**

- Import completes within 30 seconds for configurations up to 10MB
- Success rate of 99.9% under normal network conditions
- Clear progress indication throughout the process

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import a configuration THEN the system SHALL fetch the file from Supabase Storage using the config ID
2. WHEN import occurs THEN the system SHALL validate the TaptikContext format and Claude Code compatibility
3. WHEN configuration is retrieved THEN the system SHALL parse metadata and verify target IDE compatibility
4. WHEN import completes THEN the system SHALL return a validated TaptikContext ready for deployment
5. IF import fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with config ID and failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation of imported configurations, so that I can safely deploy settings to Claude Code without security risks or compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL use FormatValidator to check TaptikContext structure and Claude Code compatibility
2. WHEN security scanning occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and flag sensitive data using existing SECURITY_PATTERNS
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL provide a sanitized configuration ready for Claude Code deployment
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error codes and actionable remediation steps
5. IF security risks are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically sanitize or block deployment based on severity level

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy ALL Claude Code configurations including agents, commands, and global settings, so that my entire Claude Code environment can be replicated from cloud storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying global settings THEN the system SHALL:
   - Update ~/.claude/settings.json with permissions, env vars, and statusLine configurations
   - Deploy custom agents to ~/.claude/agents/\*.md with proper metadata
   - Deploy custom commands to ~/.claude/commands/\*.md with execution permissions
   - Update global CLAUDE.md instructions and steering files

2. WHEN deploying project settings THEN the system SHALL:
   - Create/update .claude/settings.json in project root with project-specific configurations
   - Deploy project CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md with proper content merging
   - Configure .mcp.json for MCP servers with validation and compatibility checks

3. WHEN mapping configurations THEN the system SHALL:
   - Preserve existing custom agents/commands not included in import to avoid data loss
   - Merge permissions arrays intelligently without duplicates or conflicts
   - Handle file conflicts with backup strategy and user notification

4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL:
   - Provide detailed summary of deployed agents, commands, and settings with file paths
   - List any conflicts resolved, files skipped, or permissions updated
   - Generate deployment manifest for future rollback operations

5. IF partial deployment fails THEN the system SHALL:
   - Roll back only affected components while preserving successful deployments
   - Keep successfully deployed items intact to maintain partial functionality
   - Provide granular rollback options for specific components (agents, commands, settings)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive CLI commands for the import/deploy workflow, so that I can integrate Claude Code deployment into my development scripts and automation with full control over the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `taptik deploy <config-id>` THEN the command SHALL import from Supabase and deploy to Claude Code in one operation with platform validation
2. WHEN I use deploy command THEN it SHALL support comprehensive options:
   - `--platform <ide>`: Target IDE platform (claude-code|kiro-ide|cursor-ide), defaults to claude-code
   - `--dry-run`: Preview changes without actual deployment
   - `--backup-dir <path>`: Custom backup directory location
   - `--force`: Skip confirmation prompts for automated workflows
   - `--only <component>`: Deploy specific components (settings|agents|commands|project)
   - `--skip <component>`: Skip specific components during deployment
   - `--validate`: Run validation only without deployment
   - `--diff`: Show differences between current and incoming configurations
   - `--conflict <strategy>`: Conflict resolution (skip|overwrite|merge|backup)
3. WHEN platform is specified THEN the command SHALL:
   - Validate platform compatibility with the imported configuration
   - Use platform-specific deployment strategies and file paths
   - Provide platform-specific validation and warnings
   - Currently only support 'claude-code' with clear error message for other platforms
4. WHEN commands execute THEN they SHALL provide:
   - Progress indicators for each deployment step (import, validate, backup, deploy)
   - Validation results with specific warnings and errors
   - Deployment summary with affected files count and locations
   - Rollback instructions and backup manifest location if deployment fails
5. IF deployment fails THEN commands SHALL:
   - Return standardized exit codes:
     - 0: Success - Deployment completed successfully
     - 1: General Error - Unexpected error occurred
     - 2: Validation Error - Configuration failed validation checks
     - 3: Auth Error - Authentication/authorization failed
     - 4: Network Error - Connection to Supabase failed
     - 5: Platform Error - Unsupported or incompatible platform
     - 6: Conflict Error - Unresolvable file/setting conflicts
     - 7: Rollback Error - Failed to restore previous state
   - Provide detailed error information for debugging and troubleshooting
   - Suggest corrective actions based on error type and context
   - Preserve backup manifest for manual recovery operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and rollback mechanisms, so that failed deployments don't corrupt my Claude Code environment or leave it in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur during import THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and provide clear timeout messages
2. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL preserve original Claude Code settings and provide automatic rollback
3. WHEN validation errors are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide specific corrective actions
4. WHEN partial deployments occur THEN the system SHALL track applied changes and enable complete rollback to previous state
5. IF critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed debugging information while protecting sensitive configuration data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive security validation during deployment, so that malicious or compromised configurations cannot harm my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing configurations THEN the system SHALL:
   - Scan for potentially dangerous commands (e.g., rm -rf, eval, exec)
   - Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
   - Check for suspicious patterns in agent/command definitions
   - Verify HTTPS communication with Supabase

2. WHEN security risks are detected THEN the system SHALL:
   - Block deployment of high-risk configurations by default
   - Require explicit --force flag with warning prompts for override
   - Log all security warnings to audit file
   - Sanitize sensitive data before logging errors

3. WHEN handling credentials THEN the system SHALL:
   - Never store Supabase credentials in plaintext
   - Use secure system keychain or environment variables
   - Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - Clear sensitive data from memory after use

4. WHEN concurrent deployments are attempted THEN the system SHALL:
   - Implement file-based locking mechanism (.claude/.deploy.lock)
   - Prevent race conditions during file operations
   - Queue or reject concurrent deployment attempts
   - Clean up lock files on process termination

5. IF security validation fails THEN the system SHALL:
   - Provide specific security warnings without exposing sensitive details
   - Suggest remediation steps for identified risks
   - Create security audit log for review
   - Block deployment unless explicitly overridden with admin privileges

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deploy functionality to integrate with existing linting and build processes, so that all operations maintain code quality standards and type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploy code is written THEN it SHALL pass ESLint validation with existing project rules and formatting standards
2. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are created THEN they SHALL compile without errors and maintain strict type checking
3. WHEN build processes run THEN they SHALL include deploy functionality in automated testing with proper coverage
4. WHEN code changes are made THEN they SHALL follow existing NestJS architecture patterns and naming conventions
5. IF quality checks fail during development THEN the build SHALL fail and provide specific remediation steps for compliance

## Edge Cases and Mitigation Strategies

### Network and Connectivity

- **Network Interruption**: Implement resumable downloads with partial file recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retry logic
- **Large Files**: Stream processing for configurations > 10MB

### Version Compatibility

- **IDE Version Mismatch**: Version compatibility matrix validation before deployment
- **Configuration Schema Changes**: Schema migration support for older configurations
- **Missing Dependencies**: Pre-flight checks for required IDE features

### File System Issues

- **Permission Denied**: Pre-deployment permission checks with clear error messages
- **Disk Space**: Verify adequate disk space before deployment
- **Corrupted Local State**: Integrity checks and repair mechanisms

### Concurrent Operations

- **Multiple Deploy Commands**: File-based locking with timeout and cleanup
- **IDE Updates During Deploy**: Detect and pause deployment during IDE updates
- **User Modifications**: Detect manual changes during deployment process

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Import: < 30 seconds for configurations up to 10MB
- Validation: < 5 seconds for standard configurations
- Deployment: < 10 seconds for complete Claude Code setup
- Rollback: < 5 seconds to restore previous state

### Reliability

- Deployment Success Rate: 99.9% under normal conditions
- Rollback Success Rate: 99.99% when initiated
- Data Integrity: Zero data loss during failed deployments

### Usability

- Clear progress indicators with percentage and ETA
- Colored output for better readability (respecting NO_COLOR env)
- Verbose logging with --verbose flag for debugging
- Interactive prompts with sensible defaults

### Security

- All operations auditable via ~/.claude/.deploy-audit.log
- Sensitive data never logged in plaintext
- Secure credential storage using system keychain
- Command injection prevention in all user inputs
