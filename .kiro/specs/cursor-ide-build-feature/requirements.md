# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing the `taptik build --platform=cursor-ide` feature that enables users to collect and transform Cursor IDE settings into the standardized Taptik format. Cursor IDE is a VS Code-based AI-powered development environment that extends traditional IDE functionality with advanced AI features including code completion, refactoring suggestions, and intelligent documentation.

The feature will scan Cursor IDE configuration directories (both global ~/.cursor/ and project-specific .cursor/), collect relevant settings including AI configurations, VS Code-compatible settings, extensions, and code snippets, then transform them into Taptik's standardized format for cross-platform synchronization and cloud sharing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

3. WHEN Cursor IDE platform is selected THEN the system SHALL display "Building from Cursor IDE platform..." message
4. WHEN Cursor IDE platform is used THEN the system SHALL scan both global (~/.cursor/) and project-specific (.cursor/) configuration directories
5. IF Cursor IDE directories are not found THEN the system SHALL display clear error message indicating Cursor IDE is not installed or configured
6. WHEN scanning directories THEN the system SHALL detect VS Code compatibility mode and adjust collection strategy accordingly

### Requirement 2
